Boris Bikes
===
my second time doing it
---

This Boris Bikes project models the actual bicycle renting and managing system in central London. 

It mimics real-life interactions between people, bikes, pickup/drop-off vans, docking stations and garages.

At this stage, this is my third week learning Ruby from Makers Academy.
